CONFIDENCE INTERVALS OF FRAGILITY CURVES
From Yilmaz et al. (2018) 
"Notable variations are observed in bridge fragility curves due
to inherent uncertainties in input parameters. 
However, the observed variations do not provide a good platform to estimate
confidence intervals of fragility curves through which uncertainty
in bridge fragility characteristics can be quantified. This
is because, 20 random combinations of uncertain input parameters
did not produce enough unique fragility curves at a certain
damage state and flood hazard level, and hence curves overlap.
For example, at minor damage state of the bridge only 10 unique
median values (hence, 10 unique fragility curves) are obtained
under 2-year flood condition. This number is even low for higher
damage states. At moderate damage state of the bridge, mostly all
fragility curves overlap, and thus only one (or two) unique value
of median fragility parameter c is obtained at this damage state
for any flood hazard level. While less variation in c may be an
indicator of less variability in fragility curves due to parameter
uncertainty, statistical uncertainty associated with the estimation
of fragility parameters cannot be ignored. This led to the generation
of higher samples of c through Monte Carlo simulation for
quantifying uncertainty in fragility curves of the studied bridge.
Uncertainties in bridge fragility curves are measured through
90% confidence intervals (i.e. between 5 and 95% exceedance
probabilities) of median fragility parameter (c). A three-step procedure
is followed for this purpose (as described in Banerjee &
Shinozuka, 2008; Shinozuka, Banerjee, & Kim, 2007)."
